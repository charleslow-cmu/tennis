    <h1>ATP Tennis Visualizer</h1>
    <p>If you follow ATP tennis, it would be clear who the big names are. However, do you know which was Nadal's best year of tennis? Do you know which tournament offers the highest prize money? Have you heard of tournaments with carpet surface? If such trivia interest you, read on!</p>
    <p>In this interactive data visualization website, we will be exploring the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
	    <li>How did top players' win/loss ratios change over the years?</li>
	    <li>Using ELO rankings, how did their rankings change over time?</li>
	    <li>What would happen if certain surfaces were not in play? Would Nadal still be Nadal without Clay?</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Tournament Surfaces</h2>
    <p>What tournament surfaces were most popular and had the highest prize money offered? Here we have a look at total prize money over the years for each court surface. Note that prize money has been converted from the original currency to US Dollars, and inflation has been accounted for.</p>

    <script src="surface.js"></script>
    <p>It is immediately clear how total prize money has exploded over the years as tennis has become more commercialized. In particular, there seems to be two waves of increase, the first in 1990 and the second in 2014. Interestingly, carpet used to be a prominent surface, until it was outlawed in 2009 as there were too many injuries on that surface. We can also see that grass tournaments actually only account for a small slice of the prize money pool, whilst Hard Courts are the most popular.</p>


    <h2>Global Interest</h2>
    <p>One dimension of tennis is that it has become more globalized over time. Let's look at how it spread over time.</p>

    <p>As we can see, tennis has always been a popular sport in Europe, but we can see it spread to other continents over time. Interestingly, grass and clay used to be more popular surfaces, but they got replaced by hard courts over time. Did you know that the Australian Open used to be played on grass courts? To get a better view, you can zoom into the Europe region and see how the tournaments evolved over time!</p>

    <h2>Player Scores</h2>
    <p>How did each player fare based on overall wins and losses? Here is a scatterplot to show you. Mouse over to see player names.<p>
