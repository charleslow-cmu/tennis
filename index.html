    <h1>ATP Tennis Visualizer</h1>
    <p>If you follow ATP tennis, it would be clear who the big names are. However, do you know which was Nadal's best year of tennis? Do you know which tournament offers the highest prize money? Have you heard of tournaments with carpet surface? If such trivia interest you, read on!</p>
    <p>In this interactive data visualization website, we will be exploring the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
	    <li>How did top players' win/loss ratios change over the years?</li>
	    <li>Using ELO rankings, how did their rankings change over time?</li>
	    <li>What would happen if certain surfaces were not in play? Would Nadal still be Nadal without Clay?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Player Scores</h2>
    <p>How did each player fare based on overall wins and losses? Here is a scatterplot to show you. Mouse over to see player names.<p>
