    <h1>ATP Tennis Visualizer</h1>
    <p>If you follow ATP tennis, it would be clear who the big names are. However, do you know which was Nadal's best year of tennis? Do you know which tournament offers the highest prize money? Have you heard of tournaments with carpet surface? If such trivia interest you, read on!</p>
    <p>In this interactive data visualization website, we will be exploring the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
	    <li>How did top players' win/loss ratios change over the years?</li>
	    <li>Using ELO rankings, how did their rankings change over time?</li>
	    <li>What would happen if certain surfaces were not in play? Would Nadal still be Nadal without Clay?</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Tournament Surfaces</h2>
    <p>What tournament surfaces were most popular and had the highest prize money offered? Here we have a look at total prize money over the years for each court surface. Note that prize money has been converted from the original currency to US Dollars, and inflation has been accounted for.</p>

    <p>It is immediately clear how total prize money has exploded over the years as tennis has become more commercialized. In particular, there seems to be two waves of increase, the first in 1990 and the second in 2014. Interestingly, carpet used to be a prominent surface, until it was outlawed in 2009 as there were too many injuries on that surface. We can also see that grass tournaments actually only account for a small slice of the prize money pool, whilst Hard Courts have become the most popular surface, probably owing to its ease of maintenance and durability over time. Notice also the dip in prize money in 2008, owing to the great recession.</p>


    <h2>Global Interest</h2>
    <p>One dimension of tennis is that it has become more globalized over time. Let's look at how it spread across the globe over time.</p>

    <script src="tourney.js"></script>
    <p>As we can see, tennis has always been a popular sport in Europe, but we can see it spread to other continents over time. Perhaps the first striking thing is that there used to be many smaller tournaments especially scattered across the US. However, over time there has been a consolidation toward less, but larger tournaments. In particular, the grand slams did not seem to be that big of a deal in the past, but the prize money for these tournaments has overshadowed other tournaments in more recent years (look for the biggest bubbles!).</p>
    <p>Interestingly, <span class='grass'>Grass</span> and <span class="clay">Clay</span>used to be more popular surfaces, but they got replaced by  <font color="#567b96">Hard courts</font> over time. The most surprising fact for me was that the Australian Open used to be played on Grass way back in the 1970s, but it has switched to Hard courts since.</p>
